## Directions

- Mix together water, yeast, and sugar in bowl. Let proof for a few minutes
- Once proofed, add 2 cups flour, salt, oil, and splash of cream or milk. Mix to combine.
- Slowly add more flour until the mixture thickens.
- Switch over to rubber spatula and incorporate additional flour, mixing well to combine.
- Reserve last cup of flour in measuring cup, use as 'kneaded'. Place dough on a lightly floured counter top and start the kneading process.
- Knead to your heart's content
- Put dough in oiled bowl, cover dough with oil. Cover dough with dish-rag.
- Slightly heat oven (for 1-2 minutes) at 200 F, turn off oven
- Let dough rise in oven for 90-120 minutes (may be shorter or longer depending on temperature)
- Knead dough back down. Cut dough into two equal portions. Put one portion into loaf bread pan, shape other half into a baguette. Let rise for 60 minutes.
- 30 minutes into the second rise, preheat over to 450 F, place a water bath on the bottom rack. 
- Place dough on a large cookie sheet, rub dough down with water (to make better crust and makes it easy to score)
- Bake on rack above water bath for 10-15 minutes, reduce heat to 350 and continue to bake.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions

- Ratio of 1 cup whole wheat and remaining white flour is a good balance.
