## Directions
- In a large bowl, combine sugar and water. Sprinkle yeast on top and let sit until foamy, 5 minutes. 
- Add 1 cup flour and, using a mixer, beat on medium until smooth, 2 minutes. 
- Add fine salt, egg, and butter and beat until combined. Add remaining 2 cups flour and, with a wooden spoon, mix until just combined. 
- Lightly coat a large bowl with cooking spray. Transfer dough to bowl, lightly coat with cooking spray, and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight (or up to 2 days). Dough will double in size.
- Divide into 27 equal pieces (1 ounce each). Lightly coat 9 standard muffin cups and your hands with cooking spray. Roll each dough piece into a smooth ball and place 3 balls in each cup. 
- Liberally coat with cooking spray and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, 45 to 90 minutes.
- Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake rolls until puffed and deep golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with coarse salt; serve warm.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- Watch proofing on bread, it's easy to over-proof.
