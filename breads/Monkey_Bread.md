- Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. 
- Cut biscuits into quarters. 
- Shake 6 to 8 biscuit pieces in the sugar cinnamon mix. 
- Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pan. Continue until all biscuits are coated and placed in pan. 
- If using nuts and raisins, arrange them in and among the biscuit pieces as you go along.
- In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the brown sugar over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over the biscuits.
- Bake for 35 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Do not cut! The bread just pulls apart.
