## Directions
- Grate the cheese and place into a large bowl.
- Add the yuca flour, baking powder and salt to the cheese and mix.
- Depending in the size of the food processor, belend the cheese and flour in 2-3 batches until well mixed.
- Add a proportional amount of butter, eggs, and 1-2 tablespoons of water.
- Mix until small dough balls begin to form, if it's too dry add 1-2 tablespoons of water or milk. Add more if needed.
- Remove the dough from the food processor and roll into a ball, combine batches.
- Roll out small round balls with the dough and place on a cookie sheet with parchment paper, or greased mini muffin pan.
- Chill in fridge for 30 minutes.
- Bake at 400F for about 5 minutes. Once the 5 minutes is done, turn up the heat to broil and cook until golden brown on the tops.

Additional Notes
- Dough tast
- The dough ahead of time and store in the refrigerator for up to a day.
- Can be stored in the freezer and baked whenever without dethawing
- I froze them without a lid so they dried out a litte, were very good and crunchy when mixed with adobo powder.
- To make the dough by hand, combine all the ingredients in large bowl, using melted (cooled down) butter, and mix until you have a smooth dough. It's actually very easy to prepare by hand.
