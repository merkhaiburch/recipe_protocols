## Directions

For the Cake:
- Heat oven to 375Â°F. Grease two 8 or 9-inch round baking pans. I like to cut a round piece of wax or parchment paper for the bottom of the pan also, to make sure the cake comes out easily.
- Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. 
- In a separate bowl combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla and mix well.
- Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix to combine. 
- Stir in boiling water (batter will be very thin). Pour batter into prepared pans.
- Bake for 25 - 35 minutes (depending on your cake pan size. The 9'' pan takes less time to bake) or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean or with few crumbs. Cool 5 minutes in the pan and then invert onto wire racks to cool completely.

For the coconut frosting:
- In a medium saucepan add brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, egg yolks, and evaporated milk. 
- Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat. Stir constantly for several minutes until the mixture begins to thicken. 
- Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, nuts and coconut. Allow to cool completely before layering it on the cake.

For the Chocolate Frosting:
- Melt butter. Stir in cocoa powder. 
- Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency. Add small amount additional milk, if needed to thin the frosting, or a little extra powder, until you reach your desired consistency. Stir in vanilla.

Cake Assembly:
- Place one of the cake rounds on your serving stand or plate. 
- Smooth a thin layer of chocolate frosting over the cake layer, and then spoon half of the coconut frosting on top, spreading it into a smooth layer. Leave about 1/2 inch between the filling and edge of cake. 
- Stack the second cake round on top. Smooth chocolate frosting over the entire cake.
- Spoon remaining coconut frosting on top of the cake.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- There should be enough frosting to coat the outside of the cake as well as decorate the top with frosting in a piping bag.
