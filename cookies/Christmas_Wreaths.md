## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup butter
- 30 large marshmallows
- 1 1/2 teaspoons green food coloring
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 cups cornflakes cereal
- 2 tablespoons M&Ms (mini or large)

## Directions

- Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. 
- Add marshmallows, and cook stirring constantly, until melted. 
- Remove from the heat, stir in food coloring and vanilla, then stir in cornflakes.
- Set out one or two sheets of waxed paper. Fill a skillet with 1 inch of very hot water. Place the saucepan into the skillet so cookie dough stays warm.
- Quickly drop a heaping tablespoonful of cookie dough onto the waxed paper, and use lightly greased fingers to form it into a wreath shape. 
- Immediately decorate cookie with candies. Repeat to shape and decorate remaining cookies.
- Allow cookies to cool to room temperature before removing from waxed paper, about 15 minutes. Store in an airtight container.
