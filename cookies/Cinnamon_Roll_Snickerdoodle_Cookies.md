## Directions

Dough:
- Add butter to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Melt the butter, stirring occasionally. 
- Once it's melted, turn the heat to medium-low, and continue cooking the butter, stirring frequently. The butter will get foamy and bubbly, then turn a deep golden shade with a nutty, caramely aroma (7-8 minutes).
- Pour into a large bowl, making sure to scrape in all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan, and allow to cool in a heat-safe bowl for 40 to 45 minutes in the freezer.
- Add the cooled brown butter to a large bowl and whisk in the sugars. 
- Add the eggs and vanilla, and whisk until smooth and combined.
- Fold in the dry ingredients, until completely incorporated into a dough.
- Cover the dough plastic wrap and chill while making the filling.

Filling: 
- In a small bowl, cream together all the cinnamon roll filling ingredients.

Cinnamon Sugar for Rolling: 
- In a small bowl, stir together the cinnamon and sugar for rolling.

Assembly:
- Scoop cookie dough balls that are 65 grams in size. 
- Flatten each dough ball and add 2 tsp of cinnamon roll filling to the center. Encase the filling in the dough completely, making sure any seams are smoothed shut, and roll the dough back into a ball.
- Roll the balls in cinnamon sugar.
- Chill the dough balls for at least 30 minutes in the freezer or at least 3 hours in the fridge. They should feel solid coming out of the freezer.
- Bake at 365 F for 10-13 minutes. 
- Cool on a wire rack. 

Glaze: 
- Whisk together all glaze ingredients and drizzle over the semi-warm cookies (out of the oven about 15 minutes).

Serve + Store: 
- Store cooled cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for 4-5 days or in the fridge for 6-7 days.
