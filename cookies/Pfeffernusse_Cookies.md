## Directions

Cookies:
- Combine white and brown sugars in a saucepan with honey, water, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cayenne pepper. 
- Place over medium heat and whisk until the sugars dissolve and it just starts to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and let cool for 4 to 5 minutes.
- Add salt, baking soda, heavy cream, and egg and whisk until thoroughly combined.
- Add flour and stir until everything comes together as a dough.
- Transfer dough to a piece of plastic wrap. Press into a ball and wrap tightly. Place in the refrigerator and let rest for 1 to 2 days.
- When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
- Remove dough from the refrigerator and scoop into rounded teaspoons. Roll each one into a smooth ball if desired, and place on a prepared baking sheet.
- Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cookies are perfectly dome-shaped with light golden brown bottoms, 9 to 10 minutes; don't overbake. Let cool on the pan all the way down to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.

Icing: 
- Make icing by placing powdered sugar in a bowl. 
- Stir in lemon juice, a few teaspoons at a time, until icing is very thick, but still slightly runny.
- Dip the top of each cooled cookie into the icing. 
- Let it drip, then flip it over and place on a wire rack set over a piece of parchment paper and let harden.
- Optionally, sprinkle on sprinkles for added joy.
