## Specifications
- Total time: 5 mins
- Prep time: 5 mins
- Bake/Cook time:  mins
- Yield: enough frosting for roughly 15-20 cookies

## Ingredients

- 3 cups powdered sugar, sifted (375g) (weigh before sifting)
- 3-4 Tablespoons milk (I use whole milk, but any kind will work)
- 2 Tablespoons light corn syrup (see note)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Gel food coloring (optional)
- Additional candies and sprinkles for decorating (optional)


---
## Directions

- Combine powdered sugar, 2 Tablespoons of milk, corn syrup, and vanilla extract in a medium-sized bowl and stir until combined. 
- If frosting is too thick, add more milk, about a teaspoon at a time, until the frosting is thick but pipeable. If you accidentally add too much milk, add powdered sugar until desired texture is reached.  
- If coloring the frosting, divide into bowls and color as desired at this point.
- Transfer frosting to a piping bag with a piping tip.
- Pipe frosting on cookies and decorate with decorative candies, if desired.
- Allow frosting to harden before enjoying, stacking, or storing (this took several hours for me and may vary for you depending on the consistency of your frosting).
