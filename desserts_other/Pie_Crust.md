## Directions

- Mix the flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl. 
- Add the vegetable shortening and butter. 
- Mix egg, vinegar, and cold water. Put in freezer to cool.
- Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.
- Add cold liquids to dough mixture. Stir until just combined. 
- Divide the dough in half and chill (at least one hour). 
- Roll out pie crust between two pieces of saran wrap and place into pie pan. Have some crust overlap over the sides of the baking dish (it will shrink while baking). 
- Add a piece of rounded parchment paper to the bottom of the pie dish and fill pie with pie weights. 
- Bake pie for around 25-30 minutes until the bottom no longer looks soggy. 15 minutes with pie weights, 10-15 minutes without. 
- Fill with pie filling and bake with aluminium foil or crust protector around the edges.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- The dough is very wet and that's normal.
