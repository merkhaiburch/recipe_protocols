## Directions

- Sift the flour into a bowl and add the breadcrumbs, lemon zest and suet. Mix the milk with 50ml water, then stir into the flour mixture, to a soft but not sticky dough. Knead for 1–2 minutes, then divide the dough in half.
- One piece at a time, break off a quarter of the dough half, cover and set aside. Roll out the larger piece on a lightly floured surface until it is 7mm thick and will line the first pudding mould with a 2cm overhang. Line the mould.
- Repeat with the other half of the dough – breaking off, covering and setting aside one quarter and rolling out three quarters, so that both pudding moulds are lined and you have 2 smaller pieces of dough set aside.


Make the filling. 
- In a bowl mix the butter and sugar together, and place one quarter of the mixture in the base of each pudding mould.
- One lemon half at a time, place the cut side down on the work surface and make two horizontal cuts: one quarter of the way down and three-quarters of the way down the lemon half, cutting almost but not all the way through. Rotate the lemon through 180°, still facing downwards, and make a similar cut halfway down, in the opposite direction to the other two – you’ll end up with a concertina-like lemon half. Repeat for the other half. Place 1 lemon half pointed end down in each pastry-lined mould. Cover with the remaining filling.
- Roll out the remaining pastry to make 2 lids, each the same thickness as the base. Brush the pastry around the rim of the moulds with water, then top with the lids and press together firmly to seal.
- Fold a pleat in the centre of each disc of baking paper and each disc of foil (to give the puddings room to expand), then cover the pudding moulds first with a disc of pleated paper and then with the foil. Secure with string, looping it first around the rim and then across the top to make a handle.
- Place the moulds, covered sides upwards, in a steamer and steam for 2 hours, topping up the water from time to time, if necessary.
- About 20 minutes before the end of the cooking time, make the crème Anglaise. Heat the milk, cream and vanilla seeds in a pan over a medium heat to just below boiling point.
- In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together until pale and fluffy. Pour the warmed milk mixture over the egg mixture, whisking continuously until combined.
- Pour the mixture into a heavy-based pan and cook over a very low heat for 3–4 minutes, stirring continuously, until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside.
- When the puddings are ready, use the string handle to carefully remove them from the steamer and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Remove the string, foil and baking paper. Place a serving plate over the top of each pudding mould, then carefully invert the pudding out onto the plate. Serve with the crème Anglaise on the side.
