- 6 ounces pitted dates (about 7 dates preferably Medjool)
- 3/4 cup water
- 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

Toffee sauce:
- In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/4 cups of the cream with the butter, corn syrup and sugar; bring to a boil. 
- Cook over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until a deep amber caramel forms, about 30-40 minutes. The video shows a different color, disregard.
- Carefully whisk in the remaining 1 1/4 cups of cream. Strain the sauce through a sieve into a bowl.


Cake preparation
- In a small saucepan, simmer the dates in the water over moderately low heat until the water is nearly absorbed and the dates are soft, about 15 minutes. 
- Transfer the dates and any liquid to a food processor and puree until very smooth.
- Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Lightly butter six 1/2-cup ramekins. 
- In a small bowl, whisk the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt. 
- In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter with the brown sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy. 
- Beat in the egg and vanilla, then beat in the date puree. 
- At low speed, beat in the dry ingredients. Spoon the batter into the ramekins and smooth the tops. Roughly 100 grams of mixture per ramekins is right.
- Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean; let cool slightly.


Cake assembly:
- Using a small serrated knife, trim the tops of the cakes level with the rims of the ramekins. Unmold the cakes and invert them onto a wire rack. 
- Slice each cake in half horizontally. 
- Wipe out the ramekins and spoon 1 tablespoon of the toffee sauce into each. 
- Return the bottom layers of the cakes to the ramekins, cut side up. 
- Spoon another tablespoon of the toffee sauce into the ramekins and top with the remaining cake layers. 
- Spoon another tablespoon of the toffee sauce over the cakes and spread evenly. 
- Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes, or until the toffee is bubbling around the edges.


Serving:
- Let the puddings cool for 5 minutes, then run a thin-bladed knife around the insides of the ramekins; invert each pudding onto a dessert plate. 
- Rewarm the remaining toffee sauce and spoon some around the puddings. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- Potentially use cupcake pan next time or other ramekins? One pudding is too much for one person, half is about right.
