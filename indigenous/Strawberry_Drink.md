Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- Using an immersion blender works too but made too small of pieces for my taste/liking.
- Strawberries sprouted from Sky Woman's feet in the Haudenosaunee creation story. The Three Sisters of corn, beans and squash came from her head; tobacco from her heart; and various medicines and strawberries from her feet.

- For sweetener: can use sugar, agave, maple sap, palm sugar, etc.
