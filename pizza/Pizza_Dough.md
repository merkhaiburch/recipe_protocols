Notes/Comments/Suggestions

- You will need a scale for this recipe
- This may seem like a lot of oil, but it is needed for flavor and crispiness.
- Try to minimize the amount of toppings needed for pizza. Too many toppings may affect baking times and doneness, resulting in undercooked dough!
- Try to use a seasoned pan
