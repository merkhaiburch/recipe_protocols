- Bake time: 20 mins
- Yield: 1 loaf of cornbread
- Oven temp: 400 F

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon bacon drippings (no more than 1 tbsp!!)
- 2 cups cornmeal OR 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour (see note below)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional, maybe add more)
- 1 large egg (optional)
- 1 1/4 cups buttermilk
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

## Directions

Preheat pan with bacon drippings: 
- Put the bacon drippings in a 9 or 10-inch well-seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400°F with the skillet inside. (If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven or a metal cake pan.)

Make the batter: 
- Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg (if using) and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter.

Pour batter into hot skillet and bake: 
- When the oven is hot, take out the skillet. Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet.
- Bake at 400°F for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.

Rest bread in skillet, then serve: 
- Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions

Sugar is Optional: 
- Add more sugar next time, I only used 1/2 tbsp but ended up drowning all the bread in honey because it was not sweet enough.
- Whether to include sugar or not in a southern cornbread recipe is an issue for debate. We’ve included as an option a tablespoon which just intensifies the flavor of the cornmeal; it doesn’t make the cornbread sweet.


All cornmeal versus cornmeal and flour: 
- Last time I used 1 3/4 cups cornmeal and 1/4 cup flour and it was too corny. Drop cornmeal ratio next time.
- You can either use all cornmeal or a combination of cornmeal and flour to make this cornbread. If you go the all cornmeal route, note that the result will likely be very, very crumbly. That’s just how the Southern cornbread crumbles. If you would like cornbread with a little more structure, I recommend using a combination of cornmeal and flour.
