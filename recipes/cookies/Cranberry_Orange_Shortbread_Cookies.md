## Specifications

- Prep time: 2 hours 30 mins
- Bake time: 10-12 mins
- Yield: 36 cookies

## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar 
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon orange zest (zest from 2 oranges)
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup dried cranberries, chopped

## Directions

- Cream the butter and sugar together using a stand mixer or hand mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
- Add vanilla, orange zest, and salt and beat until incorporated. 
- Add flour and cranberries and beat until mixture forms into a dough.
- Use your hands to shape the dough into a ball. The dough will be slightly dry, but it will soften up as you work with it. Then, roll the dough into a log, 2-inches in diameter. You can roll it thicker but you will get less cookies out of it. 
- Wrap the log tightly with plastic cling wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours, up to overnight.
- Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a half sheet baking pan with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper.
- Cut the dough into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices, and place on the baking sheet about 1/2-inch apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes until just starting to brown on the edges.
- Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.
