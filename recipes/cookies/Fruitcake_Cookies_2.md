## Directions

Fruit Preparation:
- Snip off the hard stems of the figs with scissors or a small knife and coarsely chop the figs. In a medium bowl, combine the figs, raisins, cherries, apricots, honey, sherry, lemon juice, pecans, and a pinch of salt. 
- Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit overnight at room temperature.

Cookie assembly:
- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter, cloves, superfine sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. 
- With the mixer on low speed, add the egg and mix until incorporated. 
- With the mixer still on low, slowly add the flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt just until combined. Add ginger.
- Add the fruits and nuts, including any liquid in the bowl.
- Divide the dough in half and place each half on the long edge of a 12 by 18-inch piece of parchment or waxed paper. Roll each half into a log, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4-inch thick, making an 18-inch-long roll.
- Refrigerate the dough for several hours, or until firm.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
- With a small, sharp knife, cut the logs into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the slices 1/2-inch apart on ungreased sheet pans and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until lightly golden.
