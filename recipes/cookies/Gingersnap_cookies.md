## Ingredients

- 2 c. all-purpose flour 
- 2 tsp. ground ginger 
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 1/4 tsp. ground cloves

## Directions

- In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cloves. 
- In a large bowl, whisk together oil, molasses, sugars, egg, and vanilla. 
- Add dry ingredients to wet and mix until just combined. 
- Refrigerate dough for 1 hour. 
- Preheat oven to 350° and line two baking sheets with parchment. 
- Add sugar to a small bowl. 
- Using a large cookie scoop (about 3 tablespoons), scoop chilled dough directly into sugar and roll to coat, then place on prepared baking sheet 3” apart. Dough will still be very soft and won’t hold its shape completely. 
- Bake until edges are barely set and tops are crinkled, but centers are still soft, 14 to 15 minutes. 
- Let cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to let cool completely.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- These gingersnaps are big, gingery, and extra extra chewy.
