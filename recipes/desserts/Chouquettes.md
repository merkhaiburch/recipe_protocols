## Ingredients

For the choux pastry:
- 250ml water
- 125g flour

## Directions

- Place the water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan on the heat. Bring to a boil.
- Remove from heat and pour all the flour in one go.
- Stir with a wooden spatula, making sure that lumps do not form. The resulting dough is called 'panada'. Dry off the panada on the heat, stirring with a wooden spatula, until the paste comes away from the sides of the saucepan and forms a ball.
- Leave to cool for 5 minutes. Add one egg and combine with a wooden spoon. Add the remaining eggs one by one.
- The choux pastry is ready to use. Scoop the preparation into a piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle.
- Pipe the choux buns in staggered lines on a baking sheet, slightly greased.
- Glaze the surface of the choux buns with egg wash (egg yolk combined with one tablespoon of water). Sprinkle some pearl sugar on top. 
- Bake at 350 F for approximately 20 minutes.
- When the choux buns are puffed up and golden, remove from the oven and let cool. Enjoy!
