## Directions

Day Before Baking: 
- Combine the dried fruit in a large mixing bowl. Add the dark rum, cover, and allow the mixture to soak at room temperature for a minimum of 12 hours, or ideally 24 hours prior to preparing the fruit cake batter.

Prepare the Fruitcake: 
- Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C) with a rack in the center position. Grease pan and line with parchment paper.
- In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the all purpose flour, baking powder, spices, and salt. Set aside.
- Cream the softened butter and light brown sugar until light and fluffy. 
- Add the eggs one at a time, beating just until each egg is incorporated. The mixture will look slightly broken, that’s ok.
- Over low speed, slowly add the flour mixture until just absorbed. 
- Add the lemon zest, orange zest, fresh orange juice, grated apple, slivered almonds, diced candied ginger, and soaked dried fruit mixture (along with any liquid if it hasn’t already been absorbed).
- Stir mixture with a large spatula, scraping the edges and bottom of the bowl several times, until all of the ingredients are evenly incorporated. It is a very thick, fruit heavy mixture.
- Transfer and divide the batter evenly among the loaf pans. Use an offset spatula to smooth the batter into an even layer. 
- Set the loaf pans on the center rack, several inches apart from one another. Bake for 75 to 90 minutes, rotating the pans halfway, or until the batter is set and the tops are golden brown. The edges of the cake may also start to pull away slightly from the edges of the pan. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool completely before removing from the pans.

Storing and Aging: 
- Once the cake has cooled, carefully remove the cakes from the loaf pans and set upright. 
- Soak two large pieces of cheesecloth in brandy (they should be lightly damp, not soaking wet when you wrap the cakes, so you may need to squeeze out any excess liquor). 
- Wrap each cake tightly. 
- Cover loafs with wax paper and foil before transferring to a large Ziploc bag. 
- Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 to 8 weeks.
- Unwrap and re-soak the cheesecloth once a week.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- Was not able to find all ingredients. Made many subsitutuions with pecans, almonds, apricots, and more sweetend fruit mix to get to the same weight as the requested ingredients. We will see how it goes.
