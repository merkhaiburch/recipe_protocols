## Ingredients

Cookie:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup cocoa
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
- 1 cup shredded sweetened coconut
- 1/2 cup finely chopped blanched almonds

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

## Directions

- Line an 8 by 8-inch baking pan or casserole with aluminum foil, with long flaps hanging over each edge.


For the cookie: 
- Put the butter in a heatproof medium bowl. Bring a saucepan filled with an inch or so of water to a very slow simmer over medium-low heat. Set the bowl over, but not touching, the water. 
- Once the butter is melted, add the sugar and cocoa, and stir to combine. 
- Add the egg and cook, stirring constantly with a whisk, until warm to the touch and slightly thickened (it should be about the consistency of hot fudge), about 6 minutes. 
- Remove from the heat and stir in graham crumbs, coconut and nuts. 
- Press the dough firmly into the prepared pan. (Save the pan of water for melting the chocolate.)


For the filling: 
- Beat the butter, peanut butter and confectioners' sugar together in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until light. 
- Spread over the cookie and freeze while you prepare the chocolate glaze.


For the glaze: 
- Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl, and set over the barely simmering water. 
- Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. 
- Remove from the heat and let cool slightly. (Alternatively, put the chocolate and butter in a medium microwave-safe bowl. Melt at 50 percent power in the microwave until soft, about 1 minute. Stir, and continue to heat until completely melted, about 1 minute more.). 
- When cool but still runny, pour the chocolate layer over the chilled peanut butter layer and carefully smooth out with an offset spatula. 
- Freeze 30 minutes.


- To serve, remove from the freezer and let sit at room temperature for 5 minutes. 
- Pull out of the pan using the foil flaps and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into 1-inch squares with a sharp knife. Serve cool or at room temperature.
