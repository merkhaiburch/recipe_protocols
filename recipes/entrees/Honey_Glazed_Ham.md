## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup water, or as needed
- 2 whole star anise
- 12 whole cloves, or more to taste (only had ground clolves, used a couple of dashes)
- 1 (7 pound) country-style ham
- 1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar

## Directions

- Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
- Pour water, star anise, and cloves into the bottom of a roasting pan. Place a roasting rack into the pan over the water, anise, and cloves; place ham on rack. 
- Cut 1/4-inch deep slashes 1/2-inch apart lengthwise and crosswise across the top of the entire ham.
- Bake ham in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 
- Whisk brown sugar, honey, mustard, vinegar, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl until glaze has a thick, smooth consistency.
- Brush glaze all over ham. Continue baking ham, brushing glaze on every 20 minutes, until glaze is deep golden and ham is heated through, about 2 hours 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F.
- Use a kitchen torch to heat the glaze on the ham until it is crispy and caramelized, 2 to 5 minutes or broil.
