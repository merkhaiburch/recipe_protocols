## Directions

- Combine the beef with the marinade ingredients and mix well to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes. 
- In a separate bowl, combine the ingredients for the stir-fry sauce and mix well. Set aside for later. 
- Heat the oil in a large wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the onion, ginger and garlic and stir-fry for about half a minute. Then add the beef and spread the strips out in the pan as much as possible. Allow the beef to sear for a minute before flipping. Stir-fry for another minute or until youâ€™ve got some nice colour on the beef. 
- Add the cooked noodles and the stir-fry sauce. Stir-fry until well combined and the sauce is thick and glossy. Toss through the spring onions and serve.
