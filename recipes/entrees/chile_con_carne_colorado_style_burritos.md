## Directions

Chilie Sauce
- In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups stock to a simmer. Meanwhile, set a skillet over medium-high heat and toast the peppers (in batches, if need be) until they’re fragrant, slightly charred, and a little more pliable. Transfer them to a heatproof bowl, pour the simmering stock over them (weight down with a small bowl if they won’t stay submerged), and set aside to steep for 30 minutes. When they’re soft, cut them open and scrape out some or all of the seeds (leave them in for spicier chile), then use a blender to purée them with the steeping liquid until completely smooth.

Beef
- Trim the fat from the beef and cut it into approximately 1-inch cubes; season with salt and black pepper.
- Warm 2 tablespoons oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Separately, line a baking sheet with paper towels or a metal rack.
- Working in batches, sear pieces of beef on one side, leaving space between them so you don’t crowd the pan; cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes, until nicely browned. Transfer immediately to the lined sheet, leaving one side raw (this helps it stay tender when it braises), and repeat with the rest.

Combining elements
- Decrease the heat to medium. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the onion for the rice; add the rest to the pot along with the bell pepper, carrot, and 1 ½ teaspoons salt. 
- Sauté until the onion is soft with a little color, 5 to 10 minutes. 
- Stir in 4 cloves of minced garlic, cumin, oregano, and cinnamon and toast for a minute or two, until fragrant.
- Add the beef back to the pot along with the bay leaves, chili sauce, and 3 cups stock. Increase the heat to high just until the sauce comes to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is falling-apart tender, 2 ½ to 3 hours.

Assembly
- To make the burritos, preheat the oven to 400°F/205°C. Spread a ladleful of the chili sauce over the bottom of a rectangular baking dish. 
- Using a slotted spoon, scoop some beef into the center of each tortilla; add some rice. Wrap burrito-style and arrange the burritos snugly, seam side down, in the dish. 
- Ladle more sauce over all the burritos to cover, then sprinkle with the shredded cheese and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is lightly browned. Garnish with cotija cheese; serve with a knife and fork (and napkin).
