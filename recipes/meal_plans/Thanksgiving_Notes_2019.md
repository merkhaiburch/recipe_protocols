### Notes

Wednesday night
- To make the stock
- 2 whole garlic, cut in half
- Small whole bag of carrots, chopped
- 5 stalks of celery
- Package shiitake mushrooms (8-9)
- 1 ½ cup chardonnay wine
- Turkey bits (neck, giblets, fat, carcass)
- Rough chop all vegetables, place in a baking sheet and place in 400 F for 40 mins to 60 mins until turkey bits were brown
- Place all stuff from baking sheet into stock pot, pour in juices too. Flake off browned turkey bits with wine and add to stock pot. Fill pot with water to top. Add ~3 crushed bay leaves, couple leaves sage, some parsley and thyme. No salt
- Bring stock to small little rolling boil with the lid off, reduce to a simmer for 5-6 hours (guideline, not rule)
- Strain out big bits and then use smaller strainer to filter out smaller bits
- Allow to cool, move to the fridge to cool completely
- Next morning skim off fat from top of stock, keep some fat for other dishes
- Aliquot out stock into tupperware, put in fridge.

### For turkey
- Cut turkey into parts using Chef Tips video on youtube
- 24 pound turkey still slightly frozen after 6 days in fridge, follow usda guidelines
- Turkey dry rubbed in equal parts kosher salt and sugar.
- Pat down extra juices, place in sous vide bags with double folded paper towels at mouth to wick up extra liquid before vacuum sealing with 4 leaves of sage per baggie
- Sous vide breasts for at least 8 hours, up to 24 hours at 130F-135F, thighs at 150F for 8 to 24 hours

### For bread
- (30 minutes night before, 15 minutes  rolling, 1 hr 30 mins rising, 20 mins baking)
- https://www.marthastewart.com/945643/no-knead-cloverleaf-rolls
- Let sit overnight in fridge
- Roll out dough balls in morning, put in oiled cupcake pan. 
- Let dough rise next to sous vide (rotating 180 degrees for warmth every 30-ish minutes)
- Bake at 350 F for 20 minutes. Brush with butter and  rebake near end. Sprinkle with kosher salt once out  of oven.

### For pies (2 hours)
- Defrost pie crusts in fridge for a few days
- Pre-bake pie crusts
- Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. 
- Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350° and bake crust until edges are golden, 20–25 minutes. 
- Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. 
- Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). 
- Notes: try making actual pie crusts next year. Store-bought crusts got too crispy and flaky. Pecan pie filling went below crust, created burnt inedible layer due to cracks in egg-wash seal

### For corn mac and cheese (40 minutes)
- 1 mini-milk (12 fl oz) full milk
- 3-4 tablespoons butter
- 2 ½ tbsp flour
- 5-6 oz water
- Whole bag shredded kraft cheddar cheese

- Breadcrumbs
- 1 ½ tsp mustard
- White pepper to taste (1 tsp)
- 1 ½ tsp worcheshire sauce (Couple glugs)
- Make a rue with flour, butter. 
- Add in milk to make bechamel. When it starts to thicken, add in cheese slowly. If it’s too thick, and some water. Add more cheese if too thin. Mix to combine. 
- Add in mustard, wite pepper, worcheshire sauce  to taste
- Boil pasta in heavily salted water, drain when aldente
- Mix cooked pasta with cheese mixture
- Put in aluminum serving tray, sprinkle over breadcrumbs, cover with foil, and put aside.
- Bake when ready

### Stuffing (20 minutes)
- 2 boxes Stove Top turkey and chicken stuffing
- 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced
- Butter
- Cook celery in all the butter recommended by the Stove Top package until translucent
- Add in 1 part water and 1 part homemade stock until warm. 
- Place dried stuffing mixtures into aluminium serving tray, pour liquid-celery mixture over dried stuffing mixture and mix.
- Cover with foil and put aside until ready to bake.
- Note: next year make stuffing from scratch (Brandon Monier: 2019-11-28) How hard could it be right?

### Gravy
- Make rue with butter and flour with 4 tbsp flour and 4 tbsp butter. Thicken with cornstarch. 
- Slowly add in 4 cups of turkey stock
- If  gravy is too thin, add in cornstarch-water slurry to thicken
- Add salt to taste. Add more unsalted butter if needed. Add a splash of nutmeg, black pepper, and msg.

### Mashed potatoes
- Cut ~2.5 lbs of potatoes into equal sized pieces
- Boil potatoes in water until softened
- Add 4 sticks of butter and cream and mix. Season to taste

### Timeline
- Started cooking at 12 noon (to eat at 3). Finished at 3:06 (overall good timeline) Made in order: 1) mac and cheese, 2) stuffing, 3) gravy, 4) mashed potatoes 5) fried turkey

### What would you change?
- Get a smaller turkey (got 24 lbs this year), next year try 15 lbs turkey
- Less potatoes (1 pound instead of 1.5 lbs)
- Same amount of mac and cheese
- More roux for gravy, use schmaltz from stock
- Make own pie crusts
- Get real pie weights?
- “Just because we can doesn’t mean that we should”

### What did you like?
- Potatoes good but very rich, less would be better
