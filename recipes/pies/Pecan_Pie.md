## Directions

Pie Crust:
- Mix the flour, salt, and sugar in a bowl. 
- Add the vegetable shortening and butter. 
- Mix egg, vinegar, and cold water. Put in freezer to cool.
- Work the butter into the flour using a dough cutter until the mixture resembles tiny pebbles.
- Add cold liquids to dough mixture. Stir until just combined. 
- Divide the dough in half and chill (at least one hour).
- Roll out pie crusts between two pieces of saran wrap and place into pie pan. Have some crust overlap over the sides of the baking dish (it will shrink while baking). 
- Add a piece of rounded parchment paper to the bottom of the pie dish and fill pie with pie weights. 
- Bake pie for around 30 minutes until the bottom no longer looks soggy.  

Filling:
- Mix the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, corn syrup, butter, vanilla and eggs together in a bowl.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  
- Pour the pecans in the bottom of the prebaked pie shell. 
- Pour the syrup mixture over the top. Cover the top and crust lightly/gently with foil.
- Bake the pie for 30 minutes. Remove the foil, and then continue baking for 20 minutes, being careful not to burn the crust or pecans. 
- The pie should not be overly jiggly when you remove it from the oven (though it will jiggle a bit). If it shakes a lot, cover with foil and bake for an additional 20 minute or until set. Required baking time seems to vary widely with this recipe. Sometimes it takes 50 minutes, sometimes it takes 75!
