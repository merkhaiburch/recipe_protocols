## Ingredients

- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/2 tsp white peppercorns
- 2–3 cilantro root or 6–8 cilantro stems, chopped
- 250 g regular ground pork
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 small green onion, finely chopped

- 2–3 Tbsp Sriracha hot sauce (see note)

## Directions

- Using a mortar and pestle, grind garlic, peppercorns and cilantro stems or roots into a fine paste.
- If your mortar is big enough to mix everything in, you can continue the recipe in the mortar, otherwise transfer the herb paste into a mixing bowl.
- Add the pork, soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornstarch, sugar, and sesame oil (if using) and mix thoroughly.
- Once mixed well, stir in the green onions.
- Wrap the wontons, following the video instructions above, or try other shapes as shown in my 5 Ways to Wrap Wontons video. I do not recommend “The Ruffled Purse” for frying because that leaves the filling exposed to the oil, and if using the “pyramid” do not make them fat and chubby like the one I showed in the video, keep the filling to 1 tsp! Wonton wrapping tips: Do not overstuff (no more than 1 tsp of filling per piece) as these only take 1 minute to fry, so there won’t be time to cook a big ball of filling. Make sure you get out as much air as possible before sealing the wontons otherwise you will get big bubbles when you fry them! (See video for an example)
- Heat about 1.5-2 inch of frying oil in a pot, heat the oil to 325 °F.
- While you wait for oil to heat, mix up the dipping sauce by stirring the two sauces together. Taste and adjust the flavour by adding more of either sauces—more sweet chili sauce for a sweeter sauce, and more sriracha for something spicier and tangier.
- Fry the wontons for about 30 seconds to 1 minute or until the wrappers are golden and the bubbling starts to subside (a sign that the wrappers are crispy.) Keep the heat low, if your oil temp is too high the wonton wrappers will burn before the filling cooks.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions

- Different brands of sriracha vary in terms of spiciness and tanginess, so start with 2 Tbsp and go from there. If you find the dipping sauce too strong, you can also thin is out with a little water.
