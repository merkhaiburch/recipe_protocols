- 4 1/2 tsp sugar

## Directions

- Set a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt to the water (1 tsp salt for every 1 litre of water). 
- In a mortar and pestle, pound garlic, spur chilies, Thai chilies and fingerroot (if using) into a rough paste. Alternatively, you can mince everything together.
- Combine all sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.
- Add spaghetti to the boiling salted water and cook until al dente. 
- Cook the ground beef in a little vegetable oil, stirring to break up any clumps, until fully cooked. Remove the beef, draining off any excess fat. Wipe the wok with paper towel to get rid of excess beef fat.
- Add a little vegetable oil and sauté garlic-chili mixture over medium heat until golden. 
- Add vegetables, cooked beef, a teaspoon of the sauce and toss for 30 seconds. Your spaghetti should be a few minutes away from being done at this point, so turn off the stove and wait until the spaghetti is ready.
- When the spaghetti is done, use tongs or a pasta scoop to transfer the spaghetti directly into the wok. Turn the heat back on to medium high, add all remaining sauce and sugar, then toss until all the sauce is completely absorbed. Add a splash of the pasta water (less than 1/4 cup). 
- Turn off the heat, add white pepper and holy basil and toss just to wilt the basil.
