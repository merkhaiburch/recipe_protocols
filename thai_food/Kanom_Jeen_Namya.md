## Directions

Poach & pound the fish: 
- Add about 1 inch of water to a medium pot along with the big chunks of lemongrass, 5 pieces of galangal, and the 1 root of grachai. 
- Bring to a simmer then add the fish, letting it poach until fully cooked (you may need to flip the fish halfway through if the water doesn't cover the fish).
- Turn off the heat and place the fish into the mortar (or a mixing bowl) and let cool slightly. Fish out the herbs from the poaching water and discard, saving the water.
- Once the fish is no longer steaming hot, pound it until fluffy and fine, or without a mortar and pestle you can just mash it in a mixing bowl with a fork or a potato masher. Set aside.

Make the curry sauce: 
- To a blender, add the soaked dried chilies, two cans of namya paste (if no cans: lemongrass, galangal, grachai, garlic, shallots, turmeric and shrimp paste); then add just enough of the coconut milk to blend. 
- Blend until smooth and pour into the pot that still has the fish poaching water in it.
- Add the remaining coconut milk to the pot, the pounded fish, 1 Tbsp of the palm sugar, and 2 Tbsp of the fish sauce. The sauce should look a little too thin right now as it will reduce a bit, so if it looks perfectly thick and luscious, add a little more water to thin it out. Simmer the sauce on LOW heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, make the noodles: 
- Bring a pot of water to a boil, add the noodles and cook till tender (mine takes 7 minutes, but this time will differ depending on your specific type of noodles). 
- Drain the noodles and add them to a bowl of cold water. Using your fingers, grab a bunch of noodles with your thumb and middle finger, shaking them under water to release any tangles, then place them in a bundle on a paper-towel-lined plate. Set aside, covered in plastic wrap.

Returning to the soup: 
- Once the sauce has simmered for 20 minutes, if it looks too thick, add more coconut milk or water. Taste and adjust seasoning with more fish sauce and/or sugar as needed (make it strong since youâ€™ll be pouring this over noodles). 
- Then add the tamarind juice and taste; the tamarind should just bring brightness to the sauce without tasting distinctly sour. 
- Serve over noodles.

Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- If you cannot find fresh grachai, look for ones in brine in a glass jar, available at Asian grocery stores that carry a lot of Southeast Asian products.

If namya paste is not available, use the following ingredients:
- 1 stalk lemongrass, bottom half only, sliced
- 5 rounds galangal
- 3 Tbsp chopped grachai
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1/3 cup chopped shallots
- 1 inch turmeric root, sliced, or 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp fermented shrimp paste (gapi)
