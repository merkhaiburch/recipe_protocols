## Directions

-  In a mortar and pestle or food processor, pound garlic and salt together to create a paste. 
- Mix the garlic salt paste with the cooked rice. Then combine everything with the pork. Optional: if adding vermicelli noodles, now is the time to add it. 
- Using a funnel or sausage stuffer, slip the casing onto the end of the funnel or stuffing tube, leaving a 5-inch tail off the end to tie up later. 
- Push all the sausage mixture through the casing. Starting at one end, remove any air from the casing and tie two knots to secure the filling. At every 1-inch below the knotted end, squeeze and twist the sausage to form round links. Tie two knots at the end of the casing. 
- Hang them in a warm, dry spot (about 68°F-70°F) for about 2-4 days, depending on how sour you want them to taste. You can cut off and cook an individual link to taste test for your preferred amount of fermentation. 
- When the sausages are ready, cook them in a pan or grill until browned. Serve with garnishes and an ice cold beer!
