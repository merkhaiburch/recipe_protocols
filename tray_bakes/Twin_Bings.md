Notes/Comments/Suggestions
- I bought my cherry pieces off Amazon, Log House also offers "premium quality CHERRY flavored Baking Morsels."
- For thicker bars, use a 8x9 pan or a brownie pan.
- If no cherry chips are available, use Watkins Cherry extract. Use white chocolate chips and add four capfulls of the extract and red food coloring (optional). You can also add the flavoring to taste.
